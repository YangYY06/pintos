## Booting Pintos

>A1: Put the screenshot of Pintos running example here.



## Debugging

#### QUESTIONS: BIOS 

>B1: What is the first instruction that gets executed?

ljmp   $0x3630,$0xf000e05b

>B2: At which physical address is this instruction located?

0xffff0



#### QUESTIONS: BOOTLOADER

>B3: How does the bootloader read disk sectors? In particular, what BIOS interrupt is used?

read_sector

>B4: How does the bootloader decides whether it successfully finds the Pintos kernel?

By checking MBR signature, partition type and bootability.

>B5: What happens when the bootloader could not find the Pintos kernel?

It prints "Not found", and indicates boot failure to the BIOS using interrupt `int $0x18`.

>B6: At what point and how exactly does the bootloader transfer control to the Pintos kernel?

The bootloader transfers control to the Pintos kernel after successfully loading the kernel into memory. It converts the 32-bit linear address of the kernel's entry point to a 16:16 segment:offset address format suitable for real mode, stores it in a temporary memory location, and then performs a far jump (ljmp *start) to the converted entry point.

#### QUESTIONS: KERNEL

>B7: At the entry of pintos_init(), what is the value of expression `init_page_dir[pd_no(ptov(0))]` in hexadecimal format?



>B8: When `palloc_get_page()` is called for the first time,

>> B8.1 what does the call stack look like?
>>
>> 

>> B8.2 what is the return value in hexadecimal format?
>>
>> 

>> B8.3 what is the value of expression `init_page_dir[pd_no(ptov(0))]` in hexadecimal format?
>>
>> 



>B9: When palloc_get_page() is called for the third time,

>> B9.1 what does the call stack look like?
>>
>> 

>> B9.2 what is the return value in hexadecimal format?
>>
>> 

>> B9.3 what is the value of expression `init_page_dir[pd_no(ptov(0))]` in hexadecimal format?
>>
>> 



## Kernel Monitor

>C1: Put the screenshot of your kernel monitor running example here. (It should show how your kernel shell respond to `whoami`, `exit`, and `other input`.)

#### 

>C2: Explain how you read and write to the console for the kernel monitor.
